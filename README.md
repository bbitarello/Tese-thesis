# Tese-thesis
A template for writing your PhD in Latex format / Um template para escrever sua tese de doutorado

I got my PhD at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (BRazil) so my thesis is mostly in Portuguese (Intro & Conclusions, first and final chapters). The meat of the thesis (two middle chapters) are manuscripts I had at the time.

Feel free to use and modify. 

```
git clone 
```

You will need to know some Tex but you should end up with [a very pretty thesis](https://teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/41/41131/tde-02122016-171335/publico/Barbara_Bitarello_SIMPL.pdf).

Enjoy!
